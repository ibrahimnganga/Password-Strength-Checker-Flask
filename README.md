# Password-Strength-Checker-Flask

A simple web application built with Flask that evaluates the strength of user passwords and suggests improvements. The application checks various criteria to determine password strength and provides feedback to users.

## Features

- Evaluates password strength based on length, character variety (uppercase, lowercase, digits, special characters).
- Provides feedback on whether the password is Weak, Okay, Good, or Strong.
- User-friendly interface for easy interaction.

## Technologies Used

 Python: The programming language used for backend development.
	
 Flask: A lightweight web framework for building web applications.
	
 HTML/CSS: For creating the frontend user interface.
	
 Regular Expressions: For validating password criteria.

 ## Installation

  -Prerequisites

     `cd Password_Strength_Checker-Flask`

     
  3. Create a virtual environment(optional but recommended):

     `python -m venv "any-name-you-want"`
     
     `source venv/bin/activate`
     
     `On Windows use venv\Scripts\activate`

## Code Overview

The main logic for evaluating password strength is implemented in the `password_strength` function, which checks for:

- Minimum length (8 characters)
- Presence of uppercase letters
- Presence of lowercase letters
- Presence of digits
- Presence of special characters

The function returns a score that determines the strength category of the password.
